# ExampleBot
A bot showcasing the Command Client in the JDA-Utilities library

# Dependencies
* [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)
* [JDA-Utilities](https://github.com/JDA-Applications/JDA-Utilities)

# Note
This bot is not really intended to be run by itself. It could be, but it doesn't really... do anything; just the most basic commands. Instead, the intention is that it can be used to show the combined power of JDA and the JDA-Utilities libraries.
